Photosynthesis is a system of biological processes by which photosynthetic organisms, such as most plants, 
algae, and cyanobacteria, convert light energy, typically from sunlight, into the chemical energy necessary 
to fuel their metabolism. Photosynthesis usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that produces 
oxygen. Photosynthetic organisms store the chemical energy so produced within intracellular organic compounds
(compounds containing carbon) like sugars, glycogen, cellulose and starches. To use this stored chemical 
energy, an organism's cells metabolize the organic compounds through cellular respiration. Photosynthesis 
plays a critical role in producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and it 
supplies most of the biological energy necessary for complex life on Earth.
